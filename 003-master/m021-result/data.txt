This panics because we don't have a file named data.txt in our directory. Try creating a file with the same name with any arbitrary text in it and run this program again to see it succeed. First, though, let's do something about that warning. Warnings are always a sign of poor code quality, and we ideally want to have none of them. The warning is there because File::read_to_string (a method from the Read trait) returns a value of type Result<usize>. Rust warns you whenever a return value from a function call is ignored. Here, the usize value in Result<usize> tells us how many bytes were read into the string.
